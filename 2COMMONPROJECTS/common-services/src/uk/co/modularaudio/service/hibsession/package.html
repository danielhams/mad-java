<P>The hibernate session service provides methods for obtaining and releasing hibernate sessions.</P>
<P>It is not intended that persisted components depend on and use this service directly.</P>
<P>They should obtain the current thread local session from the uk.co.modularaudio.util.hibernate.ThreadLocalSessionResource so they
take part in any existing transaction.</P>
