<P>The buffered image allocation service provides buffer backed allocation and de-allocation of some supported image types.</P>
<P>The buffers returned are sub-buffers of a standard Java BufferedImage of the relevant type.</P>
<P>Audio component GUIs (MadUiInstance) will typically require some image buffers on instantiation and free those same buffers on destruction.</P>
<P>In addition to providing DSP GUI buffers, this service is used by the ComponentDesigner itself to optimise transient buffer usage in the
application such as for the wires on the back of the rack.</P>
