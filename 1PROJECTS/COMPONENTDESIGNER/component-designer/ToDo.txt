For release 0.0.3:
------------------

* Fix mixer names to remove (interpolated) in the name.

* Demote soundfileplayer2 to alpha. I need to fix the metadata service dependencies and work out the proper way to do that stuff.

* Demote static value and scale and offset to beta - there isn't anything to use them yet.

* Demote stereo compressor to alpha since it has broken sub-period event processing.

* Demote spectral roller to alpha (put off the re-work until 0.0.4)

* Update DcTrap to stereo for completeness, fix frameOffset in processing.

* Fix Wave Roller to include "Scale" selection and put a scale in there.

* Fix Spectral Amp to include "Scale" selection and put amp/freq scales.

* Fix new component name suggestion to be something that will work. Occasionally fails at the moment as there isn't a proper check.

* Make mid sid processing a little more presentable.

* Pass on "released" components to check all is well.

* Investigate and fix the "updates even when values not changing" bug in the slider / rotary bits.

* Implement fastFloatPrint and check uses of slowFloatPrint.

* Documentation - javadoc, component map and building.

For release 0.0.4:
------------------

* Fix spectral roller to include "Scale" selection and put amp/freq scales.

* Create a mechanism for CI / easy(ish) building.

* Fix up sound file metadata handling so we the user can override discovered metadata and we can start to fix up the BPM handling.

Oustanding issues:
------------------

* Component versioning
* Database versioning + migration
* Exporting soundfile + metadata library as XML/json
