For release 0.0.4:
------------------

* Demote spectral roller to alpha (put off the re-work until 0.0.4)

* Fix spectral roller to include "Scale" selection and put amp/freq scales.

* Look into sensible way for multi-arch checkin/build of native libs.

* Fix up sound file metadata handling so we the user can override discovered metadata and we can start to fix up the BPM handling.

* Look into find a way that sub-rack changes avoid a double fade - would be nice to fade in the new sub-rack in parallel with fading out the old sub-rack. May be tricky due to multi-output. Would still be nice to have as a feature of the rack.

* Clicking in a slider outside of the handle and holding down should gradually jump in that direction.

Oustanding issues:
------------------

* Component versioning
* Database versioning + migration
* Exporting soundfile + metadata library as XML/json
