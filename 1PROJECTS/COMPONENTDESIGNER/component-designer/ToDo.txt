For release 0.0.4:
------------------

* Demote spectral roller to alpha (put off the re-work until 0.0.4)

* Fix spectral roller to include "Scale" selection and put amp/freq scales.

* Look into sensible way for multi-arch checkin/build of native libs.

* Fix up sound file metadata handling so we the user can override discovered metadata and we can start to fix up the BPM handling.

* Look into find a way that sub-rack changes avoid a double fade - would be nice to fade in the new sub-rack in parallel with fading out the old sub-rack. May be tricky due to multi-output. Would still be nice to have as a feature of the rack.

* Clicking in a slider outside of the handle and holding down should gradually jump in that direction.

Oustanding issues:
------------------

* Component versioning
* Database versioning + migration
* Exporting soundfile + metadata library as XML/json

Cheap Wins:
-----------

* Instead of calling repaint() in the UI code, look into a "changed" boolean and use that in the scheduled displayTick callback to cause a repaint.
* Fix up textbox in mixer lanes to be speedy textbox
* Amp meters - maybe think about redoing this component as it's very expensive for something that should be relatively cheap.
* Work out sensible strategy for getting two floats plus a parameter out in a single message.
